**MDMeld: Information Exchange for Human-AI Collaboration**

MDMeld is an initiative to create a human-readable markdown format for exchanging information, designed to facilitate seamless collaboration between humans and AI assistants. Whether you're sharing codebases, datasets, or project documentation, MDMeld aims to simplify the process, making it easy to share and process in web chat interfaces, IDEs, or version control systems.

MDMeld is a service of [3 Leaps](https://github.com/orgs/3leaps) ([3leaps.net](https://3leaps.net)), and is developed in collaboration with [Docemist](https://github.com/docemist).

## About MDMeld

MDMeld is in the early stages of development, focusing on creating a format that combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of structured metadata. Our goal is to enable users to share information with AI assistants effortlessly, fostering collaboration in a variety of contexts.

Stay tuned for updates as we work toward our initial release, which will include libraries, documentation, and tools to help you get started with MDMeld.
